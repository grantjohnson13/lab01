# Looping
Ask the user for a number. Starting with 'A', print that number of letters of the alphabet. If the number entered is greater than 26, only print the entire alphabet. If the number is 0 or less, print nothing. All letters must be on the same line (not taking into account tiny terminal windows and/or large fonts).

## Hint
- The second requirement regarding 0 and negative inputs takes care of itself if your loop is well-designed.

## Remember
- You are now required to include a comment block at the top of the file. See the Coding Guidelines handout.
